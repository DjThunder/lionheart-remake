L11 Just want to hand out a big 'thank you' to all dedicated LH
L11 supporters out there. I really appreciate it and i hope to
L11 give something back one day. Also would like to praise
L11 Pierre-Alexandre for doing such a insanely good job and
L11 keeping it all alive for old and new LH gamers! I'm always
L11 looking back with lots of good thoughts and fun developing
L11 LH in those days discovering my capabilities fed by all the
L11 other talented people around me. It just makes me proud that
L11 people still appreciate the work done so many years ago.
L11 Thanks and may the pixel be with you! :)

L11 After working in the games industry for 20 years, most get
L11 hard-boiledand jaded. So many games produced, so much work
L11 invested, and for what? Games are high tech and are obsolete
L11 so very fast. Nobody remembers the hits of last year, not to
L11 mention old 16 bit games, right? And then there is the
L11 occasional moment that reminds me why I'm still passionate
L11 about making games even after all these years. To some people,
L11 the games we worked on so long ago are part of their memories
L11 and of their youth. They had an emotional impact to them, they
L11 mattered and made a difference to at least some. And that
L11 makes it all worth while - the long hours, the daily struggle.
L11 Projects like the Lionheart remake and people like
L11 Pierre-Alexandre, it's creator, reassure me that I've made the
L11 right decision to dedicate my professional life to games.
L11 And for that reassurance, I thank Pierre-Alexandre, the
L11 original creators of Lionheart, Henk Nieborg, Erwin Kloibhofer,
L11 Michael Bittner and Matthias Steinwachs. And most of all,
L11 thanks to everybody out there who had fun with our games and
L11 who still remembers...

L11 For the re-release-remake-re-anything-whatever of that great
L11 game (thanks a lot to Pierre-Alexandre - great job, man) its
L11 time to reveal a secret: Did you ever asked yourself "Who is
L11 that hero with that long blonde hair in Lionheart?" So here
L11 it comes: Its Henk, the graphic designer! So if you now also
L11 find Erik, Erwin & me maybe you'll win a prize :-) So have
L11 fun to play Lionheart & feel free to visit my website
L11 (www.audiotexturat.de) And yes - someday the music-remake
L11 will come - its done when its done...
